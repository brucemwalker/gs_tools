# Grandstream Plug and Play Responder
## Description

This application runs either standalone or as a system daemon
(background process). It watches for Grandstream Plug and Play
broadcasts from GRP26XX-series phones during every boot process,
logs details to stderr, and optionally responds with a configuration
URL that the phone will use to read config files from.

## Environment

The application is written in pure Python3 and requires no extra
classes or libraries beyond the stock Python installation.

It was developed and tested under macOS 12 (Monterey) and FreeBSD
13.  I expect it will run without changes under pretty much any
flavour of macOS, BSD and Linux. It will most likely run in some
fashion under Windows if Python3 is installed, but don't hold me
to that.  I will test that later on.

On macOS you will possibly need to install a more recent Python than
the OS comes with. See [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) for that.

## Command line arguments
```
% ./gspnp_responder -h
gspnp_responder [-vh] [url]
  -h   -- help; this message
  -v   -- verbose; extra debug stuff
  url  -- send configuration URL, eg http://192.168.1.2/gs/
          if no url, passively log beacons
```

## Installation and use
### Standalone utility

You can launch `gspnp_responder` in a terminal window where it will
run until killed (eg control-C). Run without arguments it passively
displays the details of any GRP26XX series phone it sees booting.

Eg:
```
% gspnp_responder
Sun Dec  5 15:13:08 2021 | SUBSCRIBE mac:c074ad515e41 192.168.1.2 Grandstream GRP2612W fw 1.0.5.67
```

### System daemon

For use as a permanent system service, `gspnp_responder` is designed to be
managed by [supervisor](http://supervisord.org/)

Copy the application file `gspnp_responder` to a system directory.
On FreeBSD I suggest `/usr/local/sbin`. Make sure it's set to
executable.
```
% sudo cp gspnp_responder /usr/local/sbin
% sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/sbin/gspnp_responder
```

Add appropriate lines to the `supervisord.conf` configuration file:
```
; Grandstream Plug and Play responder

[program:gspnp_responder]
command=/usr/local/sbin/gspnp_responder -v http://192.168.1.2/gs/grp/
stderr_logfile=/var/log/gspnp_responder
```

Update supervisor:
```
% sudo supervisorctl update all
% sudo supervisorctl status
gspnp_responder                  RUNNING   pid 6960, uptime 0:00:06
nginx                            RUNNING   pid 4706, uptime 1 day, 1:37:39
```

## Usage notes

### Network considerations
The Grandstream "Plug and Play" protocol makes use of the SIP
protocol for discovering a user-agent profile. This involves
broadcasting (multicast) a SIP subscribe request for the ua-profile
event to the local network.  Generally broadcasts like this do not
propagate beyond the subnet that the phone is connected to. This
of course means that the `gspnp_responder` must be running on a host
on the same subnet as the phones it will auto-configure.

### Zero-config
I was moved to create this application because configuring a brand
new or factory-reset
[GRP2612W](https://www.grandstream.com/products/ip-voice-telephony/carrier-grade-ip-phones/grp-series-professional-ip-phones/product/grp2612-p-w?hsLang=en)
phone for WiFi on my home office network is a decided
pain in the butt. Programming the WiFi settings--especially the
shared secret--using just the phone keyboard is incredibly annoying.

So my procedure now is to run an instance of `gspnp_responder` on
a laptop or mini-PC with an ethernet port and a light web server.
Then I connect the GRP2612W phone with a CAT-5 patch cable to the
laptop and reboot it.  The phone will send its beacon, `gspnp_responder`
will send back the configuration URL (through a SIP NOTIFY ua-profile
event message) and the phone will read a configuration file from
the dedicated web server on the laptop. That configuration file
will contain settings to program the WiFi settings so that once the
phone reboost it will be on my office WiFi network where I can
connect to it to finish setup.

Some example p-values are:
```
P1650 = 3
P7800 = 1
P8403 = Wi-Fi_Name
P8404 = Shared-Secret
P8405 = 4
```

If you convert these to Grandstream XML--you can use my `pvalues2xml`
conversion tool in this package; see
[Provisioning](https://github.com/brucemwalker/gs_tools/tree/main/provisioning)
--you'll get:
```
% pvalues2xml.py GRP261X.txt | xmllint --format -
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<gs_provision version="1">
  <!--Generated by /Users/bmw/bin/pvalues2xml.py-->
  <config version="1">
    <P1650>3</P1650>
    <P7800>1</P7800>
    <P8403>Wi-Fi_Name</P8403>
    <P8404>Password</P8404>
    <P8405>4</P8405>
  </config>
</gs_provision>% 
```

Save that in a file called `cfg.xml` in the web server and all
GRP26XX phones will read it.
